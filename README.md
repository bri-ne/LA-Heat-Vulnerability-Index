# MUSA 611 Final Project Template

## Project Proposal
## by Bri Cervantes and Aidan Cole

For our final project, we will be generating an extreme heat vulnerability
index for the city of Los Angeles. Taking inspiration from the City of Philadelphia's
"Philadelphia Heat Vulnerability Index" story map, we hope to highlight the
populations and areas within Los Angeles that are most vulnerable to extreme
heat events. To do this, we will 1) conduct a literature review to assess which
demographic groups would be most susceptible to extreme heat events, 2) gather open
source data to create features that represent the social and physical vulnerabilities
for each Census tract in the City, 3) calculate and map the physical and social
vulnerability of each Census tract in the City, and 4) overlay the physical and
social vulnerability maps to reveal the area's of the City that are most
vulnerable to extreme heat events.


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide literature and explanations
regarding the demographic groups that are considered most at-risk to extreme heat
events. These include: percent of population over 65 years of age, percent of
population over 25 years of age with no high school education, percent of
limited English-speaking households, percent of population below the Federal
Poverty Level, percent of population that identifies as "non-white", percent of
population over 65 years of age and living alone, percent of adults diagnosed with
asthma, percent of adults diagnosed with Chronic Obstructed Pulmonary Disease,
percent of adults diagnosed with Coronary Heart Disease, percent of adults
diagnosed with diabetes, percent of adults diagnosed as obese, and percent of
adults diagnosed with hypertension. Scores for each of these demographic features
will range from 3 (lowest sensitivity) to 14 (highest sensitivity).
In order to calculate a Census tract's physical vulnerability, we will use
granular temperature data, as well as land-use (% tree canopy/impervious surfaces)
and proximity features (ex. distance to community sprayground or cooling center).
With the arbitrary physical and social vulnerability scores that we find for
each Census tract, we will produce our final deliverable of an interactive
story map - illustrating the areas of Los Angeles that are most susceptible to
extreme heat events and identifying important local community resources that
exist to help people cope with or mitigate the effects of extreme heat. The ultimate
goal of this project is to inform the City of Los Angeles of this multi-faceted
issue and to help with the allocation of climate adaptive resources and strategies.

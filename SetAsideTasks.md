# mobile view
- make text for filter/slide/arrow button smaller so it all just takes up less space
- when adding the accordion heading for the table, be sure to flip the layout so they are stacked instead of side by side 
  
# big screen
- add accordions within the data table popup


## in general
- ~~`if no boxes checked then show nothing~~ 
- there are nulls in parks taht need to be changes to empty strings or "no info" or something

## how to divvy up work??
- split up the work by feature
  - ex. a search box is afeatures
  - toggleing layers on and off are a feature
  - popup and tooltips are their own feature (seems good for aidan)
  - working on legend 

## how to plan for smaller screen sizes, like css can only go so far right? what about how placement of div inside html affects what you can do? e.g. stuff inside a flex box row. it just squeezes. I know theres felx box wrap but I have stuff rotated is that gonna .. hmmm (see drawing)
- html grunt, thing is precompiler that you can write a html doc, run it through the precompiler and then have that as an object you call on. seems like can be put into array to be called on like we do.

## In these css animation functions is it better to set the styles in css and then use the functions to apply those styles OR use the function to set the style directly?


## The function that I found to do accordion stuff in vanilla js has the entire funciton wrapped in parenthese, i think so that it is like always active and doesmn't have to be called.why? how do I change this without messing everything up?
- this for scoping purposes, the close/open functions in this "module" won't affect the close/open funciton in the global scope and vice versa
- stretch goal would be to -- modulize-- the function for the vertical too
  - not necessary though

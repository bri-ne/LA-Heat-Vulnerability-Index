## how to divvy up work??

## how to plan for smaller screen sizes, like css can only go so far right? what about how placement of div inside html affects what you can do? e.g. stuff inside a flex box row. it just squeezes. I know theres felx box wrap but I have stuff rotated is that gonna .. hmmm (see drawing)

### Button Functions

## In these css animation functions is it better to set the styles in css and then use the functions to apply those styles OR use the function to set the style directly?

## The function that I found to do accordion stuff in vanilla js has the entire funciton wrapped in parenthese, i think so that it is like always active and doesmn't have to be called.why? how do I change this without messing everything up?
